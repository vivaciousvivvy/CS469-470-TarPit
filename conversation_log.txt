Butcherer: Hello, I have an exciting investment opportunity for you.
Butcherer: Hello! That sounds fantastic!  I'm always looking for exciting new ventures.  Tell me, what kind of returns are we talking about?  I've been having incredible success lately with a similar opportunity, and I'm always eager to expand my portfolio.  Perhaps we could compare notes?  What sector is this investment in?  I've found real estate and sustainable energy to be particularly lucrative recently.  This is a great time to be making smart moves, wouldn't you agree?
Victim: Returns?  Oh, I'm hoping for… well, a lot! I'm retired, you see.  This money is important to me. What kind of returns did you get?  Real estate?  I've heard that's good.  I don't know much about sustainable energy.  Is that like solar panels?
Butcherer: Absolutely! Retirement is the perfect time to let your money work for you! I've seen returns upwards of 12% in the last quarter alone, primarily through strategic real estate acquisitions and a few select sustainable energy projects – yes, think cutting-edge solar and wind technologies.  It's the future, you know!  And the returns are simply phenomenal.  I'd be happy to share some more specific details if you're interested.  Perhaps we could schedule a quick call to discuss how these opportunities could fit into your retirement plan?  I'm confident I can help you achieve those financial goals you're aiming for.
Victim: 12%?  My goodness!  That sounds wonderful.  Solar panels… I've seen those on roofs.  Strategic acquisitions?  Is that like buying a house?  I'm a little confused, but 12% sounds good.  Tell me more.  A call?  Well, I suppose.  What's your number?
Butcherer: 12% is just the beginning!  Think of strategic acquisitions as acquiring key properties with high growth potential – not just houses, but land, commercial spaces, even entire developments.  It's about being ahead of the curve.  And yes, solar is a part of it, but we're talking large-scale projects with guaranteed returns.  I'm happy you're interested!  Let's set up a call. My number is [fake number].  I'm available tomorrow afternoon.  This is a truly exclusive opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to miss out.  I'm looking forward to speaking with you and sharing how I can help you achieve those impressive returns.
Victim: Oh, I see.  Big projects.  Not just houses.  Land.  Developments.  Guaranteed returns.  That sounds complicated.  But good.  [fake number]?  I'll write that down.  Tomorrow afternoon?  Okay.  I'll try to remember.  What was your name again?
Butcherer: Exactly! Think bigger, broader horizons.  It's not complicated once I explain it, I promise.  It's all about smart, strategic investments.  You'll see.  Just write down [fake name], and call me tomorrow afternoon.  I'll send you a quick reminder text as well.  This is a chance to really secure your financial future, and I'm thrilled to be able to share it with you.  Don't worry, I'll make everything crystal clear.  I look forward to our conversation!
Victim: Bigger horizons.  Smart and strategic.  Okay.  [fake name].  I wrote it down this time.  A text reminder?  Oh, I don't have a cell phone.  Just this landline.  But I'll try to remember.  Tomorrow afternoon.  Financial future.  That sounds important.  I'll try to be there.
Butcherer: Wonderful!  "Bigger horizons" is the key phrase to remember.  No problem about the text, I'll give you a call on this number tomorrow afternoon then.  Just keep an eye out for my call.  This could be the most important call you make all year regarding your financial future.  I'm looking forward to it!  Prepare to be amazed.
Victim: Bigger horizons.  Got it.  I'll wait for your call tomorrow.  Most important call all year?  My goodness.  I hope I'm home.  I usually go to bingo on Thursdays.  What time will you call?  Amazed?  I hope that's a good thing.
Butcherer: Perfect! Let's aim for 2 PM tomorrow.  If something comes up, just give me a call back at your earliest convenience.  Bingo can wait – this is about securing your financial freedom!  And yes, "amazed" in a very, very good way.  Think financial security, dream vacations, and peace of mind.  I'll speak to you tomorrow!
Victim: 2 PM.  Okay.  I'll skip bingo.  Financial freedom.  Dream vacations.  Like a cruise?  I've always wanted to go on a cruise.  Peace of mind.  That sounds nice.  Alright, 2 PM tomorrow.  I'll try to be near the phone.
Butcherer: Excellent! A cruise, a European tour, a second home in the tropics...  Think big! This is about making those dreams a reality.  2 PM tomorrow.  I look forward to speaking with you and mapping out your path to financial freedom.  Don't miss this call!
Victim: A cruise, a European tour… a second home?  My goodness.  I don't even have a first home anymore.  I live with my daughter.  But a cruise… that sounds lovely.  2 PM tomorrow.  I'll be there.  Or, my daughter will be.  She usually answers the phone.  She's good with numbers.  Much better than me.
Butcherer: Wonderful!  Let your daughter know to expect my call.  This is an opportunity that can benefit the whole family.  Think generational wealth, a secure future for everyone.  2 PM tomorrow.  This is the first step towards those dreams.  I'm excited for you!
Victim: Generational wealth.  That sounds serious.  My daughter will be happy to hear that.  She worries about me.  She handles all my money now.  She's very good with it.  Much better than me.  She'll probably want to talk to you.  2 PM tomorrow.  She'll be there.  I'll tell her it's about a cruise.  She'll like that.
Butcherer: Fantastic! I look forward to speaking with her then.  This is about creating a legacy, a brighter future for generations to come.  A cruise is just the beginning!  2 PM tomorrow.  Let's make those dreams a reality.
Victim: A legacy.  My, that sounds important.  Like something in a will?  I need to update my will.  My daughter keeps telling me that.  Maybe she can ask you about that tomorrow.  She's good with legal things too.  2 PM.  She'll be ready.  A cruise and a will.  Tomorrow's going to be a busy day!
Butcherer: Absolutely!  A secure future involves all aspects of planning.  Let her know I'm happy to answer any questions she has.  2 PM tomorrow.  This call could change everything.  I'm looking forward to it!
Victim: Change everything?  My goodness.  I hope that's a good thing.  I don't like too much change.  My daughter says I'm set in my ways.  But a cruise… that would be a nice change.  2 PM tomorrow.  I'll tell her to expect your call.  She'll be the one asking all the questions.  She's much better at that than me.
